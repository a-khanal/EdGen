# M_model (Mass model: if width of particle>1MeV, one can
#   generate the mass according to different distributions)
# 1 Breit-Wigner (Mass and Width are automatically read from  
#   output/eg_pdg_table.txt)
# 2 Flat (Generated flat in mass in the allowed range)
# 3 Just the mass at the center of the distribution
# 4 Breit-Wigner2 (Mass and Width are automatically read from
#   output/eg_pdg_table.txt) mass will still be	 generated fast also if outside the energy peak.
# 5 Gaussian and more to come

# 1  ROOT only
