# 1 Phase Space Single Energy (for example e-)
# 2 Phase Space Energy Spectrum (for example gamma)
# 3 Phase Space Energy Spectrum (for example gamma) flat energy
# 4 Cross Section (sorry, not yet)

# 7 Data Points (sorry, not yet)

# M_model (Mass model: if width of particle>1MeV, one can
#   generate the mass according to different distributions)
# 1 Breit-Wigner (Mass and Width are automatically read from  
#   output/eg_pdg_table.txt)
# 2 Flat (Generated flat in mass in the allowed range)
# 3 Just the mass at the center of the distribution
# 4 Breit-Wigner2 (Mass and Width are automatically read from
#   output/eg_pdg_table.txt) mass will still be generated fast also if outside the energy peak.
# 5 Gaussian and more to come

# output
# 1  ROOT only
# 2  ROOT + LUND
# 3  ROOT + BOS
