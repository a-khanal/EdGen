EdGen Event Generator
==================

This code is for a common Event Generator for the HASPECT collaboration.
It uses the ROOT (root.cern.ch) PhaseSpace generator has basis and 
See http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~lzana/Documents/zana_haspect_genova2014.pdf for a quick presentation on this code.
This version respect to the common version it supports the BOS output format (for CLAS6 analysis) if the system has it.

Prerequisites
-------------
* CERN ROOT  (tested at now with version ROOT 5.34.34 (seems there are problem with earlier version of root)
* git 
* cmake
* Tested on ifarm.jlab.org on June 5 2014. Needs CLAS software (and OLD CERN LIBS) 
* Environment variables on ifarm.jlab.org

.

source ./environment.csh (own version of environment variables for setting CLAS software in ifarm. It uses the latest version of root 5.34.34). This is not needed: 
1) OUTSIDE THE JLAB FARM 
2) IN THE JLAB FARM IF YOU DON'T NEED BOS SUPPORT (you are using gemc, for example)

Install
-------

* cd EdGen (go to the EdGen directory)
* mkdir build
* cd build
* if you want to install BOS output support you will need to have correctly setup in your environment variables CLAS6LIB CLAS6INC and CERNLIB (the environment show before has been tested)
* if you don't want BOS support, just unset those environment variables (CLAS6LIB CLAS6INC and CERNLIB). If you will request a BOS output the code will not create any bos file (strangely enough)
* cmake ../ 
* make 

Running
-------
* cd EdGen/output (go to the output directory)
* A table with particle properties is in this directory (from PDG) eg_pdg_table.txt :Modify it if you need it. An example of how to add particles to this table are written at the end of the file. At now the information used are just the mass, the charge of the particle and the lifetime (if the particle has vertex in your reaction diagram for this MonteCarlo. 
* A template is in input.dat (input_test.dat it is just for my developments at now), and modify the file to fit your reaction
* In input.dat one can specify the input spetrum (for example for CLAS photon beam). The input spectrum file is written in a txt files format with raw that represent for each bin E_min, E_max, Counts (Does not need to be normalize, the code is going to normalize it if need it). The bin size do not need to be the same for each bin.  An example is written in the output directory as energy.txt 
* ./EdGen -h will give you the options
* <b>./EdGen -i input.dat -o output.root        (Change input.dat or output.root (need to be a *.root) to your desired input and output file name) </b>

Examples
-------
* 3 particles in a vertex, Dalitz plots are generate using the weight (for particles that decay with more than 2 particles in a vertex). The weight is an array of all the particles and describe the weight at creation (the weight is given to the decayed particles) <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGen -i input_test2.dat <br />
** Analyze the output (with TProof) of the generated file (files analysis.C , analysis.h, run_analysis.C): root run_analysis.C <br />
** NB The weight is given as a single number (the product of the weights at each vertex) in the BOS and LUND File: For the BOS file the weight is included in the MCHD bank (check that you bank is keeped in all the step of your analysis); For the LUND file format, the weight is included where should be the value of the mass in the LUND format (since it is not used by gemc). <br />
* 2 particles per vertex, but 3 vertex <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGen -i input_test.dat <br />
